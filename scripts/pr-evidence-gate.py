"""PR evidence gate (#750; widened by #939/#940; sections collapsed by #1079).

Section checks (#939; section names collapsed by #1079): the PR body
must answer two template sections, "Upstream" and "Verified". The gate
checks that
an answer exists, not that the answer is good: a missing heading, or a
heading whose text is empty after stripping HTML comments, fails and
names the section. Headings inside fenced code blocks do not count (a
quoted template is not an answer), and the template ships its guidance
as HTML comments so an untouched template fails. What the Verified
answer must contain (the red-then-green output pair) is a reviewer
judgment, not a gate judgment.

Link checks (#750): image links in the PR body must be embedded
(`![label](url)`) and must answer HTTP 200 (catches bad SHAs).

A URL is an image link under two parallel rules (#940):

1. Extension: any https URL ending in png|gif|jpe?g|webp|svg, on any
   host.
2. Media host: any https URL on a host that serves nothing but uploaded
   media (user-images.githubusercontent.com, github.com/user-attachments)
   whose last path segment carries no file extension -- the shape
   drag-and-drop uploads produce.

raw.githubusercontent.com is judged by rule 1 alone: it serves every
committed file type, so an extensionless raw path (LICENSE, a directory
permalink) is a reference, and non-image evidence files (.json, .md,
.txt) cannot be embedded as images -- they are read as references, not
evidence (#750 scope). Measured on the 25 most recently merged bodies
at the time of the change, extending rule 2 to raw flagged 79 reference
links, every one a false positive (docs/verify/939/).

Fenced code blocks do not exempt image links: agents list evidence in
code fences, and an image link in a fence renders nowhere (#940 keeps
this a non-goal).

The link criteria are shared with the coordinator's reference
implementation `scratch/pr-evidence-check.py` (outside this repo): same
MD_LINK, IMG_EXT, IMG_URL, MEDIA_HOST_URL, TAIL_EXT,
is_media_host_image, same curl probe, same verdicts. Change one, change
the other. The section check lives only in this gate -- the reference
scanner sweeps PRs that predate the template.

Usage:
  PR_BODY='<pr body>' python3 scripts/pr-evidence-gate.py   # CI entry point
  python3 scripts/pr-evidence-gate.py path/to/body.md        # local testing

Exit 0 when the body passes, 1 otherwise. Findings name the section or
the URL (with its line for bare URLs).
