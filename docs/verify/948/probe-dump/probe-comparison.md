## Coverage

Enumerated = static scan of spec source. Collected = distinct runtime call sites that returned a value (polls/themed loops record repeatedly; distinct de-dupes by file:line).

| probe surface | enumerated | collected |
| --- | --- | --- |
| getComputedStyle occurrences (headline count) | 1 | — (captured per evaluate call below) |
| probe-carrying evaluate/waitForFunction call sites | 4 | 4 |
| .boundingBox() call sites | 4 | 4 |
| .toHaveCSS() call sites | 4 | 4 |
| visual-matcher assertion sites | 49 | 49 joined |

Comparison rows: 40 — KEPT 40, DRIFT 0, NOT-RUN 0, VIOLATION 0, other 0.

Review procedure (#910 裁定 5): every DRIFT row is either expected drift (the new canon — re-pin the spec inline value to “new measured”) or a suspected regression (fix the code, keep the baseline). KEPT rows need no action. NOT-RUN rows are assertion sites whose test failed earlier, was skipped, or was filtered out. The `note` column flags values whose source notation is not rgb/hex: `color(srgb …)` is folded to rgba for comparison (re-pin should write the rgb/hex form); oklch/lab/lch and non-sRGB `color()` cannot fold under the #411 contract and are flagged VIOLATION, never converted.

## KEPT — baseline holds on this build (40)
